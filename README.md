## Purpose
CollabPro is a platform for team leaders to efficiently create teams for various projects in the workspace. Our program uses a critical value to match users with projects, or "tasks"; skill level. Each workspace has different relevant skills, and users have assigned skill levels for each one. When a task is created, our algorithm automatically pairs available team members to projects based on how closely their skills match the desired skill level for the task. Once a task has enough team members assigned to it that the cumulative skill level is at or near the desired skill level, the team is completed.
